# Actias
Actias is an open-source, serverless platform designed for running stateless functions written in Lua. It provides everything you need to build and deploy applications without worrying about scaling, databases, or state management. With Actias, you simply upload your Lua script, and the platform takes care of running it reliably and efficiently across the globe. Built-in services like Key/Value storage and database access make it easy to manage data and persist state, so you can focus on your code instead of infrastructure. Actias is designed to be accessible for everyone, whether you're learning to code or building professional applications. Actias offers a simple, powerful suite of tools to bring your ideas to life without the complexity of server management.

```lua
add_event_listener("fetch", function(request)
    return {
        body = json.stringify({hello = "actias"}),
        headers = {["Content-Type"] = "application/json"}
    }
end)
```

> A pretty diagram of how Actias works from a general overview.

Actias, bearing resemblance to Cloudflare Workers, operates as a fully distributed system that includes Key-Value (K/V) storage combined with a bunch of other services. In this sense, it decentralizes the management of services which boosts scalability and efficiency. 

Upon uploading your lua file, the script is independently managed and run by the Actias worker on an as-needed basis. This has the advantage of maintaining operations that are consistently multi-threaded, each script execution runs in it's own context which enhances performance and availability due to high-level parallelism. Essentially operating as a layer that handles request-response cycle in between your usersâ€™ HTTP interactions and your server. 

Your code has a script instance per request, with every runtime having an almost instant startup and execution cost while being short-lived. These scripts run server-side, guaranteeing real-time responses to the user's queries and interactions. This design ensures that Actias is exceptionally robust and flexible, it will not buckle under high demand nor waste resources during quieter periods.

In the background, Actias consists of many distributed services which allow the entire program to run smoothly. It's a network of interconnected and interdependent components that make up your backend that you never have to deal with outside of the high level APIs. Despite this complexity, Actias is extraordinarily user-friendly, hand it your script, and it will take care of the rest.

## Deployment
### Docker Compose
`docker-compose` is an expirementing/local node option. It is not meant for production deployments but it will be relatively stable for deployments. This is the only option for now as this is still heavily in development. This is an AIO solution and deployment is as easy as `docker-compose up -d`, however you should run scylla and postgres seperately for anything important.
### Kubernetes
**TODO**

## Todos
Things that should be added but are incomplete or not added.
- [ ] Live Development (in-progress)
  - Websocket based way to develop Actias through the CLI without constantly publishing or polluting revisions.
- [ ] Metric Service
  - Store metrics and logs of all requests/resources used per request
  - This should have some regexes and ML algorithm for determining sensitive data in the request body and redacting it
- [ ] Vault
  - Service for storing secrets, should also be subject to ACL controls
- [ ] Split `worker` into `worker_core` and `worker_service` (backlog)
  - Worker should be split in a way that it can be embedded in the CLI and used to locally develop.
    - KV and other services that depend on actias will be stored locally in a JSON (`dev.json`)
- [ ] WASM runtime with WIT interface (backlog)
  - Will need its own binded host functions for interfacing with network since WASI doesn't have a network implementation.
- [ ] Repository (backlog)
  - Lua repository for Actias specific dependencies, interacted with through the CLI
  - Should have ability to control package versions, have descriptions, publishers, etc
  - Dependencies and versions should be stored in the `project.json`
  - Router module should be moved from templates and added to the repo
  - Additional packages that could exist: `postgrest`
