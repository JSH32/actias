# Actias
Actias is a lua based serverless scripting platform for HTTP workers and jobs.

## Deployment
### Docker Compose
`docker-compose` is an expirementing/local node option. It is not meant for production deployments but it will be relatively stable for deployments. This is the only option for now as this is still heavily in development. This is an AIO solution and deployment is as easy as `docker-compose up -d`, however you should run scylla and postgres seperately for anything important.
### Kubernetes
**TODO**
