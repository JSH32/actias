Today, we'll be creating a straightforward app with Actias, utilizing its KV storage system to save and retrieve persistent data.

Our API will accomplish the task of receiving a request and keeping a count of the number of requests made to the API.

Before we continue, ensure that the Actias CLI is installed on your system and that you have a comfortable understanding of Lua. Let's get started!

## Setting Up a New Project

First, launch a terminal and command the Actias CLI to create a new project:

```bash
actias-cli init myapi
```

A set of template options will be displayed as follows:

![template selector](/images/blog/build-a-serverless-api-with-actias/init.png)

For our demonstration, we will select the 'basic' template, but feel free to investigate other options independently.

After the selection, a new directory with the subsequent structure will be created:

![structure](/images/blog/build-a-serverless-api-with-actias/directory.png)

The `definitions` folder, automatically updated by the Actias CLI, stores method stubs provided by Actias itself and should remain unaltered.

The `script.json` file includes the project settings, hosting the project ID and other elements that are uploaded or bypassed when pushing the bundle to Actias.
```json
{
  "id": null,
  "entryPoint": "main.lua",
  "includes": [
    "**/*.lua"
  ],
  "ignore": [
    "definitions/**"
  ]
}
```

The `main.lua` file contains the actual code. Given that we picked the `basic` template, this is a simple "hello world" project.

```lua
add_event_listener("fetch", function(request)
    return {
        body = json.stringify({hello = "world"}),
        headers = {["Content-Type"] = "application/json"}
    }
end)
```
The code snippet above represents an event listener for fetching requests, sending a "hello world" in the response.

## Utilizing Actias Key-Value Storage

The Actias KV storage revolves around namespaces containing scoped values. In this architecture, all KV keys are string-typed, and their corresponding values can be a variety of types, including JSON.

## Defining a Counter with Key-Value Storage

To construct our counter, we'll be using the KV storage to keep track of the number of requests the API has received. The final script is provided below.

```lua
add_event_listener("fetch", function(request)
    local ns = kv.get_namespace("counter")
    local current = ns:get("count") or 0
    ns:set("count", current + 1)

    return {
        body = "This page has been hit " .. current .. " times!",
        headers = {["Content-Type"] = "text/plain"}
    }
end)
```
The indicated script sets an event listener that increments a count within the `counter` namespace each time a request is fetched. The current value of this counter is returned in the response body, displayed as the number of "hits" on the page.

## Deploying Your Project to Actias

First, you need to set up a project for your app. To do this, navigate to the Actias dashboard and either create a new project or select an existing one.

Once you've chosen your project, return to the CLI and execute the following command:

```bash
actias-cli publish myapi
```

After running this command, you will be guided through a series of prompts:

![publish](/images/blog/build-a-serverless-api-with-actias/publish.png)

Know that:
- The public identifier must be globally unique across the entire platform, and not just within one project. However, this rule doesn't apply to namespaces.
- The project ID is located either in the URL or on the project dashboard next to your project name.

## Navigating the Actias Dashboard

After publishing your app, your Actias dashboard should now resemble the image below. Don't be concerned if the 'counter' namespace is absent, as it will be automatically created with the first request:

![panel](/images/blog/build-a-serverless-api-with-actias/panel.png)

Upon clicking your script, a list of script revisions will be displayed:

![revisions](/images/blog/build-a-serverless-api-with-actias/revisions.png)

By pressing the link icon, you can view the script in your browser. If all steps have been followed correctly, you should be greeted with a message that reads:
```text
This page has been hit 0 times!
```

As the KV namespace `counter` is now created, you can explore it.

![namespace](/images/blog/build-a-serverless-api-with-actias/namespace.png)

This interface allows you to inspect, produce, and modify KV values according to your requirements.

## Happy Coding!
With that, our serverless counter is complete! Hopefully, you've gained a good understanding of how you can consume the Actias platform to build your APIs. It's worth noting though that while our example was quite basic, you can create much more complex scenarios harnessing Actias and Lua's power.
For a more complex example you can explore the `todo` template.
